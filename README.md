### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wes and I have experience leading teams in large tech orgs and early stage as a day 1 software dev / founder.

I have experience across the stack (frontend, backend, infra, design), but more recently I've worked on / with:

* react (web & mobile)
* mobile (react-native, some native with Swift/Obj-C/Java on iOS & Android)
* graphql on node.js
* rolling & blue/green deployment infra
* scheduled jobs, lambdas, and container management
* figma collaboration
* kanban for project management with a lightweight + granular philosophy
